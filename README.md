# MyReads Project

Built in React, the project is a bookshelf application that allows the user to
select categorize books in three categories or shelves ('Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'). Each book has a control that allows the user to swich the book shelf
which by default is the book current shelf.  The application also has a search functionality that allows the user to find more books to add to their library. By having an input field where books can be search by different options.
Included in this version is the 'Drag and Drop' functionality, so that the users also can move their
book between shelves by dragging the desired book from one shelf to another.  Also on the main page
by clicking the Book's title the user can see a page with more details about the Book.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
